    <p>Dishonest activity will result in servers being blacklisted.</p>

    <div class="innerContent">
        <p>While I reserve the right to decide what does and doesn't constitute dishonest activity, here's a few likely examples.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faking your player count or other data.</li>
            <li>The server is an illegitimate clone of another server.</li>
            <li>The server's staff have taken a hostile stance towards the San Andreas community.</li>
            <li>The server's staff have taken a hostile stance towards this service or my person.</li>
        </ul>
        <small>* An example of a hostile stance could be a threat or an attempt at causing harm or disruption.</small>

    <p>There's no such thing as a permanent block in SAMonitor. No matter the size of the transgression, if you have truly rectified it, you may appeal and be unblocked.</p>
    <p>If you own a blocked server and wish to appeal, contact me.</p>
