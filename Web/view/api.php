<p>SAMonitor provides a free API for developers and server operators to use as they wish. All we ask in return is credit.</p>

<p>No authorization or tokens are required.</p>

<p>We also provide an alternative Masterlist, which only includes server which are online or haven't been offline for over 24 hours.</p>
