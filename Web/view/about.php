    <p>SAMonitor is a SA-MP and open.mp server monitor. It tracks activity of them and is a good replacement of standard listings.</p>

    <div class="innerContent">
        <p>This is a completely free and open source project. The source code is 100% open, and so is the api. Check the menu items for access to those.</p>

        <p>SAMonitor intends to be a "spiritual successor" of SACNR Monitor. It is made and maintained by an ex-SACNR developer.</p>

        <p>Not only a successor, but also an improvement: Having active monitoring for repeated servers, faked statistics and other illegitimate servers, SAMonitor's listings could be considered higher quality than most others.</p>
