    <h2>About</h3>
    <p>SAMonitor is a SA-MP and open.mp server monitor. It tracks activity of them and is a good replacement of standard listings.</p>
    <div class="innerContent">
        <p>This is a completely free and open source project. All code and API documentation is in <a href="https://github.com/markski1/SAMonitor">SAMonitor's GitHub monorepo</a>.</p>

        <p>SAMonitor intends to be a "spiritual successor" of SACNR Monitor; made and maintained by an ex-SACNR developer.</p>

        <p>It also actively monitors for repeated servers, faked statistics and other illegitimate things.<br />As such, it provides higher quality listings than most other places, as it blocks repeated and fake entries.</p>
